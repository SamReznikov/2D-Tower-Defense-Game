## Brief Description

In 2019, I planned this tower defense game's object-oriented design with UML class diagrams. I went on to develop it in Java, using only standard libraries. The final result includes:
- Animated enemies with varying traits
- Special abilities
- Dynamic levels
- Buildable and upgradable towers with unique behavior
